Personal website built with the [Phoenix
Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)

## Getting Started

You'll need to have the following things running to work on this codebase:

1. [direnv](#direnv)
1. [asdf](#asdf) (or Elixir, Erlang, and Node.js)
1. [Postgres](#postgres)

Assuming the above are installed and running correctly

* Copy `.envrc.sample` to `.envrc` and fill out with your configuration
* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with
    `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
